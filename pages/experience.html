        <h2>Video</h2>
        <p>I've been been doing video since I was in high school. The art of being able to take an idea from my head and showing it to the world has always fascinated me.</p>

        <h2>Design</h2>
        <p>As a creative I started exploring other platforms where I could express myself, soon after I found that creating websites was entertaining. </p>

        <h2>Business</h2>
        <p>I feel that creative outlets such as video/design are powerful tools for businesses. When a business has great customer service and a great brand, competition is the least to be worried about!</p>
